# Project Slice 2 Horror Elements
 
## Player Controller
This is a modified version of [Character Movement Fundamentals](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/physics/character-movement-fundamentals-144966) that allows for better support for the "new" Unity Input system. So it works with mouse and keyboard and a gamepad. Thinking on it now... I'm not sure I'm supposed to upload this with that package? Not sure how that works...

## Dual Hand Inventory
The inventory in this project comes in the form of two invisble hands. Each hand has an associated grab button (or combination for keyboard) which can pickup, swap, and drop items. Some items can contain logic to perform an action -- the only object implemented with this is the flashlight which can toggle on and off.

## Level Design and Lighting
Not a real feature but with this project I practiced some level design and set dressing by making a spooky series of rooms. They're not really populated with anything but notable elements are:
* Windows that allow "outside" light in when another light source is not shined on it.
* Spooky guy on the top floor that only appears as a shadow.
* Two story house that could provide a series of puzzles... but don't.

## Why is it so bare?
Well there was a point where I wanted to do much more with this project but honestly with these Project Slices I really just wanna focus on a handful of mechanics and I really felt I learned my fill with the dual hand inventory and wanted to move on to a new project.
